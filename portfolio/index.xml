      <description>Once I&amp;rsquo;d discovered the UKHO site with lots of detailed bathymetry for the UK, it seemed obvious to produce a map of Loch Torridon. In the end, it worked best to concentrate on one part of the Loch.
Bathymetry of the Loch Torridon Narrows Data I used 2m, 4m and 8m resolution bathymetry of Loch Torridon from UKHO Seabed Mapping Service Ordnance Survey OpenZoomstack data with OS stylesheets. Tools I used GDAL to convert .</description>

      <description>RGB hillshade with Relief Visualisation Toolbox The idea for this map came from a blog about long barrows by the Avon Valley Archaeological Society.
Bury Ditches Hillfort, South Shropshire.
Data Data is 1m Lidar DTM from Defra download page. Data acknowledgement for Lidar data - Contains public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0. Tools I used QGIS to merge lidar data then clip to required area. Relief Visualisation Toolbox which I&amp;rsquo;d not used before.</description>

      <description>These maps are based on a tutorial on terraforming Mars with python.
Terraforming Mars Tools I used Python What did I learn? I tried using Venus instead, but areas with no data made it look ugly. Learnt about custom colour ramps in python and using two colour ramps on the same map. Fun to look at the surface of Mars as well. </description>

      <description>The brief for this day was to &amp;ldquo;write about what you&amp;rsquo;ve done with the other maps, or document or collect together in some way.&amp;rdquo;
I decided to set up an online portfolio using the Hugo static site generator.
To make this possible, I challenged myself to use entirely open or creative commons data so that I could share the end results, and tried to ensure that I acknowledged all data I used.</description>

      <description>Intervisibility between hillforts in South-west Shropshire Tools I used Made in QGIS DTM data preparation done with GDAL at command line. Data Original hillfort kml download from Megalithic Portal search. Had to inspect data and move some hillfort points to highest point of hillfort according to the Lidar data. Is there a way of doing this automatically?
Height data is merged from 2 m lidar with OS Open data Terrain 50 to fill the gaps.</description>

      <description>I originally started this map under the heading of points, but once I&amp;rsquo;d worked out the best method it ended up using lines instead.
Locating a relocated mile post The photograph on the map layout shows a mile post now on display in a garden in Bishop&amp;rsquo;s Castle, which Mum and I visited on a Gardens Open Day. My challenge was to work out where the mile post was originally located, based solely on the information it showed.</description>

      <description>I still have some ideas I&amp;rsquo;d like to try out under this heading:
Map the Roads from the Isles from the D.D.C. Pochin Mould book. Maybe on an historic map background. Or map shielings or illicit stills in Torridon? Can get Canmore data from Historic Environment Scotland. Bishop&amp;rsquo;s Castle Railway Partly inspired by old geological maps which have comments around the outside of the geology. For example, the 1893 map of Gairloch which can be seen in the BGS Maps Portal.</description>

      <description>For this map I followed a Dynamic infographic map tutorial.

What do I want to change? Could do with sorting out fonts and text sizes.</description>

      <description>The inspiration for this map came from a tutorial on mapping with hachures by Robin Hawkes.
Hachures map of Bishop&amp;rsquo;s Castle area, South Shropshire Tools I used QGIS What did I learn? Using geometry generators to create hachures. Created visual model in qgis for the process, and discovered how to apply a style file (.qml) as part of the model. That it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;hachures&amp;rdquo; not &amp;ldquo;hatchures&amp;rdquo;! </description>

      <description>Looking at OpenStreetMap data for Shropshire I realised there was a lot of landuse mapped in the South West of the county, around Bishop&amp;rsquo;s Castle and Clun Forest. So I started thinking what I could do with that.
The multipolygon layers also contained administrative boundaries, e.g. with admin_level = 10. Apparently those are civil parishes.
So I decided to compare the ratio of woodland/forest to area in a selection of parishes.</description>
